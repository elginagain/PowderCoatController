def auto_tune_pid():
    """
    Performs a relay-feedback based auto-tuning algorithm over 10 minutes.

    The algorithm toggles the heater output (relay mode) for 10 minutes while recording
    temperature readings every second. The relay is ON for 60 seconds and OFF for 60 seconds.

    After the test period, the algorithm detects peaks and troughs to estimate the oscillation period (Pu)
    and amplitude (A). Then, using a relay half-swing (h=50, assuming a 0-100% output swing),
    it computes the ultimate gain Ku and uses Zieglerâ€“Nichols rules:

        Kp = 0.6 * Ku
        Ki = 1.2 * Ku / Pu
        Kd = 0.075 * Ku * Pu

    Returns:
